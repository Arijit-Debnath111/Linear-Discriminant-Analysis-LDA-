# Linear-Discriminant-Analysis-LDA-
It's is also a dimensional reduction  algorithm which is used in ML
The process is as-
#recall->tp / (tp + fn)
#The recall is the measure of our model correctly identifying True Positives. 
#
#precision of class 0 = TP of class 0/total number of object 
#What is the Precision for our model? Yes, it is 0.1 or, when it predicts 0 digit, it is correct around 100% of the time.
#precision of class 1 = TP of class 1/total number of object
